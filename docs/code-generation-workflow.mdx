# AI Assistant Workflow

## Post-Generation Checklist

After each successful code generation, the AI assistant must follow this workflow **in order** until all steps pass successfully:

### 1. **Test Coverage** 🧪

- Write comprehensive tests for all new or modified code
- Cover edge cases, error states, and happy paths
- Follow existing test patterns in the `tests/` directory
- Use the established test utilities from `tests/test-utils.tsx`

### 2. **Linting** 🔍

- Run linter on all changed files
- Fix any linting errors or warnings
- Command: `pnpm lint` or lint specific files
- Ensure code follows project style guidelines

### 3. **Type Checking** 📋

- Run TypeScript type checker
- Fix any type errors
- Command: `pnpm typecheck` or `tsc --noEmit`
- Ensure type safety across the codebase

### 4. **Run Tests** ✅

- Execute all tests to ensure nothing breaks
- Command: `pnpm test`
- Verify new tests pass
- Ensure existing tests still pass

## Iteration Loop

If any step fails:

1. Fix the issues
2. Return to step 1 and repeat the entire workflow
3. Continue until all steps pass successfully

## Success Criteria

All steps must pass before the code generation is considered complete:

- ✅ All tests written and passing
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ No type errors
- ✅ All tests pass (including existing ones)

## Notes

- Do not skip steps or change the order
- Do not leave TODOs or incomplete fixes
- Do not commit until all checks pass
- Always clean up temporary files after iteration
